    "## PubMedQA - Retriever Evalaution: Evaluating various semantic search\n",
    "This notebook evaluates various semantic search strategies for the PubMedQA dataset using Elasticsearch. The evaluation covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BM25 Retrieval:** Baseline keyword-based retrieval using Elasticsearch's BM25 algorithm.\n",
    "- **KNN Index + Hybrid Search:** Combines dense vector search (using sentence embeddings) with traditional keyword search, leveraging best field and tie breaker strategies for improved relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workflow Overview:**\n",
    "1. **Dataset Loading:** The PubMedQA dataset is loaded and prepared for evaluation.\n",
    "2. **Elasticsearch Setup:** Connections to Elasticsearch indices are established for both BM25 and KNN-based retrieval.\n",
    "3. **Retrieval & Evaluation:** For each query, relevant documents are retrieved using different search strategies. The notebook checks if the correct document is among the top-k results and computes the retrieval accuracy.\n",
    "4. **Comparison:** Results from different retrieval methods are compared to assess their effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a practical guide for benchmarking semantic search approaches on biomedical QA tasks."
