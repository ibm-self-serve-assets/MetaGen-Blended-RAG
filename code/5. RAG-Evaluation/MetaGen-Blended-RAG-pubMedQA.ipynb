    "## RAG PubmedQA\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for generating and evaluating short, fact-based answers to PubMedQA medical questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs). The process includes prompt engineering, model inference, result cleaning, and evaluation against human-annotated answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Load PubMedQA questions and retrieved contexts.\n",
    "2. **Prompt Construction**: Build prompts for LLMs to generate concise answers (\"yes\", \"no\", or \"maybe\") based strictly on provided context.\n",
    "3. **Model Inference**: Use IBM WatsonX.ai foundation models (Mistral, Llama3, FlanT5) to generate answers.\n",
    "4. **Post-processing**: Clean and normalize model outputs.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**: Compare model-generated answers to human annotations using confusion matrix and classification metrics."
