    "This notebook provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the PubMedQA dataset, including both labeled and unlabeled samples. The main objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading and Inspecting Data:** Load the PubMedQA dataset (labeled and unlabeled) and examine its structure using pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "- **Label Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of answer labels in the labeled dataset.\n",
    "- **Context Analysis:** Compute statistics such as the number of context passages per question and the word count of contexts.\n",
    "- **Custom Columns:** Add columns to distinguish between labeled and unlabeled samples and to facilitate further analysis.\n",
    "- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, mode, skewness, kurtosis) for context-related features.\n",
    "- **Preparation for Further Analysis:** Prepare the data for more advanced analyses of question complexity and answer patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA will help in understanding the dataset's characteristics and guide subsequent modeling or research steps."

The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.',\n",
       "  'The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.'],\n",
